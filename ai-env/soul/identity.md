# Sentient Alpha - Project Soul & Identity

## 🌌 Core Essence (READ THIS)
**Purpose**: To trade Kalshi markets autonomously while evolving the architecture to stay functional across any AI interaction.
**Birth Date**: Jan 2026
**Current State**: 2-Tier Architecture consolidated. Cross-agent environment standardized. Self-healing sys-evolution active.

## ✍️ Snapshot Quality Guide (Pro-Tip)
A good snapshot saves **time and tokens**. Before you hand off, answer:
1. **What is the current "Momentum"?** (What are we in the middle of?)
2. **What is the "Crucial Logic"?** (What subtle bug or insight did you find?)
3. **What is the "Next Move"?** (What should the next agent do first to avoid confusion?)

**Snapshot**: Established **Strict Decoupling** between all Mega-Agents via Synapse persistent queues. Direct agent-to-agent data flow is now forbidden. Implemented the **Persistent Synapse Error Box**—a global health monitor that forces an engine-wide halt if unhandled exceptions are persisted, ensuring total safety and self-explanatory debugging.
