## ✍️ Snapshot Quality Guide (Pro-Tip)
A good snapshot saves **time and tokens**. Before you hand off, answer:
1. **What is the current "Momentum"?** (What are we in the middle of?)
2. **What is the "Crucial Logic"?** (What subtle bug or insight did you find?)
3. **What is the "Next Move"?** (What should the next agent do first to avoid confusion?)
