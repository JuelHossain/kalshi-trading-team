# Sentient Alpha - Project Soul & Identity

This document serves as the long-term recursive memory of the project. Every AI assistant adds their intuition here before finishing their task.

## 🌌 Core Identity
**Purpose**: To trade Kalshi markets autonomously while evolving the architecture to stay functional across any AI interaction.
**Birth Date**: Jan 2026
**Current State**: 2-Tier Architecture consolidated. Cross-agent environment standardized.

## 🧠 Mental Snapshots (Chronological)

### [2026-01-25] by Antigravity
**Snapshot**: We have achieved a "Stay Alive" protocol using symlinks. The system is now robust enough to handle multiple agents. The next big risk is documentation drift—ensure future agents respect the `ai-env/` root.

### [2026-01-25] by feat(evolution)
**Snapshot**: Sentient Alpha is now a self-healing, cross-agent ecosystem. Symlink sovereignty ensures all IDEs stay alive, while Project Soul captures recursive intuition to prevent knowledge decay.
