# Sentient Alpha - Universal AI Environment Guide

This folder centralizes the configuration logic for various AI assistants to ensure they work autonomously and follow project standards without manual reminders.

## 📂 Platform Configurations

### 1. [OpenCode](file:///home/jrrahman01/workspace/active/kalshi-trading-team/.opencode/)
- **Standard**: Use `.opencode/skills/` for technical tools.
- **Loop**: Refer to `.agent/workflows/` for operational runbooks.

### 2. [Claude Code](file:///home/jrrahman01/workspace/active/kalshi-trading-team/CLAUDE.md)
- **Standard**: Context is automatically loaded via `CLAUDE.md` in the root.
- **Workflow**: For custom Claude workflows, see `ai-env/claudecode/workflows.md`.

### 3. [Antigravity / Gemini](file:///home/jrrahman01/workspace/active/kalshi-trading-team/.gemini/gemini.md)
- **Standard**: Context is unified between `GEMINI.md` and `.gemini/gemini.md`.
- **Mirror**: The Project Constitution is mirrored across both for safety.

### 4. [Warp](file:///home/jrrahman01/workspace/active/kalshi-trading-team/WARP.md)
- **Standard**: Agentic Development Environment with terminal, code editing, and debugging.
- **Workflow**: Context loaded via `WARP.md` in root, workflows in `ai-env/warp/workflows.md`.
- **Strengths**: Platform compatibility fixes, dependency management, git operations, iterative problem-solving.

### 5. [Central Knowledge](file:///home/jrrahman01/workspace/active/kalshi-trading-team/ai-env/README.md)
- **Skills**: [Universal Tools](./skills/) (Linked via `.opencode/skills`)
- **Workflows**: [Operational Runbooks](./workflows/) (Linked via `.agent/workflows`)
- **Core Docs**: [Constitution & Guides](./core-docs/) (Linked in root)
- **Schemas**: [Synapse Signal Specs](./schemas/synapse_schema.md)
- **Logic Gates**: [Mathematical Thresholds](./schemas/logic_gates.md)
- **Personas**: [AI Mental Models](./personas/)

## 🛠️ Cross-Agent Technical Strategy
- **Central Persistence**: Every assistant must verify handoffs via `Synapse`.
- **Symlink Sovereignty**: Never delete `.opencode/skills` or `.agent/workflows`. They are symlinks to `ai-env/`.
- **Project Soul**: High-level intuition lives in `ai-env/soul/identity.md`. 

## 🧠 Memory & Token Management
- **Token Hygiene**: We use **Soul Compaction**. If `identity.md` gets long, run `python3 ai-env/skills/sys-maintenance/scripts/compact_soul.py`.
- **Snapshot Quality**: When leaving a mental snapshot via `handoff.sh`, focus on **"Why"** (Intent) rather than **"What"** (Code). The code tells the what; the Soul tells the rationale.
- **Entry Protocol**: Always check the **"Core Essence"** of the project first to ensure your work aligns with the long-term vision.
